           <img src='./kazi.jpg' />
           <p>Hello! I'm Ncebakazi Somdaka, a self-made Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for both coding and innovation. My journey into the world of technology began with an unyielding curiosity about how things work, and over the years, this curiosity transformed into a deep expertise in web development.

With a strong foundation in Marketing Management and hands-on experience as a Store Manager, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and business acumen to the table. My entrepreneurial mindset drives me to constantly seek new opportunities, and I love solving problems by creating scalable, user-friendly digital solutions.

I specialize in building dynamic and interactive websites using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. My thirst for knowledge is never-ending, and I dedicate a significant amount of time each day to learning new languages, exploring emerging technologies, and refining my craft.

When I'm not coding or developing new projects, you‚Äôll likely find me diving deep into the latest programming frameworks or brainstorming new business ideas. I‚Äôm always striving to grow both personally and professionally, with an eye on the future of technology and how it can be leveraged to create impactful, innovative solutions. </p>

            <li>My Qualifications

I hold a Marketing Management qualification from Boland College, which I obtained in 2020 at the Stellenbosch Campus. This program equipped me with a solid understanding of marketing principles, business strategy, and consumer behavior, which has proven invaluable in both my professional endeavors and entrepreneurial ventures. My marketing education has provided me with the tools to think strategically and creatively, skills I now integrate with my technical background as a full-stack web developer.

Before pursuing my higher education, I completed my Senior Certificate at Kanyolwethu Senior Secondary School in Lwandle Strand, specializing in Commercial Studies. This foundation in commerce gave me a strong understanding of business operations, financial management, and organizational dynamics, all of which have contributed to my diverse skill set as an entrepreneur and a developer.

These qualifications have shaped my ability to blend technical and business expertise, allowing me to approach projects from both a development and a marketing perspective.</li>
